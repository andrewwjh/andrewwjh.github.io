I am a dedicated and results-oriented engineer with a Master's degree in Robotics from the **National University of Singapore (NUS)**. My expertise lies at the intersection of **robotics, machine learning, and healthcare technology**. I have a proven track record of leading robotics and sensor projects through the entire lifecycle: from creative conception, multi-disciplinary design (mechanical, electronics, algorithms), and prototyping, to building robust validation platforms.

I am passionate about leveraging AI to solve complex, real-world problems and am currently seeking challenging opportunities in AI and robotics.
